## Introduction:

In calculus, particularly in dynamics, Newton's second law of motion serves as a cornerstone formula,
stating that an object's acceleration is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely
proportional to its mass, mathematically represented as $F = ma$. This relationship elucidates how forces
influence the motion of objects, with acceleration often being variable, necessitating calculus for motion
description through solving differential equations relating position, velocity, and acceleration over time.
One pivotal differential equation derived from Newton's second law is $F(t) = m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$, where $F(t)$ represents the net force as a function of time, $m$ is the object's mass, and $\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$ denotes the second
derivative of position with respect to time, representing acceleration. This equation enables the modeling
of object motion under diverse forces, finding application in physics, engineering, and astronomy,
facilitating predictions of object behavior under varied conditions and constraints.
